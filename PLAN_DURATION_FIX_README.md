# Plan Duration Fix & Testing Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers the comprehensive fixes implemented to ensure plan durations work correctly and prevent issues like displaying "2 Hours" when a user purchased "1 Day" plan.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Plan Duration Display Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Users who purchased a "1 Day" plan were seeing "2 Hours" displayed
- **Cause**: Inconsistent duration handling between `duration` string and `durationHours` number fields
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `planDurationHelper.ts` utility for consistent duration formatting
  - Updated all components to use `getCorrectDurationDisplay()` function
  - Added database triggers to enforce duration consistency

### 2. Custom Plan Support ✅
- **Problem**: Adding custom plans could break existing plans
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced PlanManager to properly handle custom plan types
  - Added validation to prevent custom plans from using standard durations
  - Created unique constraints to prevent duplicate plan names

### 3. Enhanced Admin Transaction Panel ✅
- **Features Added**:
  - Advanced pagination with page numbers
  - Multiple filter options:
    - Search by user ID, plan name, or location
    - Filter by location
    - Filter by time range (hour, day, week, month)
    - Filter by status (active, expired, used, pending)
    - Filter by specific date
  - Adjustable items per page (10, 25, 50, 100)
  - CSV export functionality
  - Clear all filters button

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite ✅
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Plan duration hours validation
  - Duration description consistency
  - Transaction expiry calculations
  - Custom plan compatibility
  - Location coverage validation
  - Active purchase status verification

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. **`/src/utils/planDurationHelper.ts`** - Utility functions for consistent duration handling
2. **`/src/utils/planDurationTests.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite for plan functionality
3. **`/src/components/admin/PlanTestRunner.tsx`** - UI component for running tests in admin panel
4. **`/test-plan-system.js`** - Command-line test runner
5. **`/FIX_PLAN_DURATIONS.sql`** - SQL script to fix database inconsistencies

### Modified Files
1. **`/src/components/admin/TransactionsView.tsx`** - Enhanced with pagination and filters
2. **`/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`** - Added System Tests section
3. **`/src/components/user/PurchaseModal.tsx`** - Uses duration helper for display
4. **`/src/components/user/PlansList.tsx`** - Uses duration helper for display

## How to Use

### 1. Apply Database Fixes
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents from FIX_PLAN_DURATIONS.sql
```

### 2. Run Command-Line Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run the test suite
node test-plan-system.js
```

### 3. Use Admin Panel Tests
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to "System Tests" in the sidebar
3. Click "Run Tests" to validate the system
4. Review any failures and apply fixes as needed

### 4. Monitor Transactions
The enhanced transaction panel now provides:
- Real-time filtering
- CSV export for reporting
- Pagination for large datasets
- Time-based analytics

## Key Functions

### `getCorrectDurationDisplay(durationHours: number): string`
Ensures consistent duration display across the application:
- 3 hours → "3 Hours"
- 24 hours → "1 Day"
- 168 hours → "1 Week"
- 720 hours → "1 Month"

### `validatePlanDuration(plan: Plan): { valid: boolean; error?: string }`
Validates that a plan's duration fields are consistent.

### `calculateExpiryDate(purchaseDate: Date, durationHours: number): Date`
Correctly calculates when a plan should expire.

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:
- [ ] All database fixes have been applied
- [ ] Command-line tests pass 100%
- [ ] Admin panel tests show no failures
- [ ] Test purchases display correct durations
- [ ] Custom plans don't conflict with standard plans
- [ ] Transactions filter correctly by all criteria
- [ ] CSV export includes all filtered data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Plan shows wrong duration
1. Check `duration_hours` field in database
2. Run `FIX_PLAN_DURATIONS.sql` script
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Custom plan conflicts
1. Ensure custom plans don't use standard durations (3, 24, 168, 720 hours)
2. Check for duplicate plan names
3. Verify plan type is set to 'custom'

### Issue: Transaction expiry incorrect
1. Check if `expires_at` is calculated from `purchase_date + duration_hours`
2. Run the expiry fix query from SQL script
3. Verify timezone settings

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the helper functions** for duration display
2. **Test new plans** before making them available
3. **Monitor the test results** regularly
4. **Export transaction data** for backup and analysis
5. **Document custom plans** with clear descriptions

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Run the test suite and save the output
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Review Supabase logs for database errors
4. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Automated daily test runs
- Email alerts for test failures
- Plan usage analytics dashboard
- Bulk plan management tools
- Historical transaction analysis
